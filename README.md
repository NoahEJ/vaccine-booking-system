# Vaccine Management System

## TL;DR

This project provides the features of a full vaccine management system, enabling patients to book appointments, nurses to deliver doses, and administrators to view analytics.

## Technical Details

- **Programming Language**: The entire project is written in Java.
- **Data Storage**: At the time it was built, this project needed to use .txt files exclusively to store data, but it can easily be adapted to take advantage of a database instead!
- **Offline Mode**: Designed to operate offline, without the need for an internet connection.

## Testing

I have also included a utility class, *MakeFakeAppts*, to generate fake appointments. This should allow you to test out the full feature set of the system. Happy booking!

## Development Info

Originally built just after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, but recently pushed to GitHub!
